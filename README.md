# Horiseon - Code Refactor Challenge

## Purpose
In this assignment, I refactored existing code for Horiseon and improved their website's accessibility and functionality. 
Accessibility features allow for inclusivity for all users and improve on the SEO - search engine optimization. 

## Steps
1. Adding semantic elements in place of div
        header, nav, footer, section (hero, content, benefits), article (content);
        both in HTML and CSS 
2. Streamline and condensing repetitive code
        Streamlining CSS by putting style codes in logical order of the HTML layout.
        Condensing CSS by using class attributes in content and benefits sections. 
        Removing unnecessary class attributes in the benefits section in HTML.
3. Adding descriptive alt attributes for img
        Descriptive sentences for images that convey meaning, and blank alt attributes for icons. 
4. Title for website is descriptive, so user knows what their tab page has. 
5. Added comments in HTML and CSS code to make it easier to identify the parts of the code, and clean up the structure in a semantic order.
